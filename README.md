# Laravel Payment Processing Function

This Laravel function is designed to handle payment processing for amortizations with a schedule date equal to or before a given date. It efficiently handles a large amount of data, including thousands of amortizations and millions of payments. The function ensures that each amortization is paid using the corresponding project's wallet balance. Additionally, if an amortization is delayed, email notifications are sent to the promoter associated with the project and to every profile that was supposed to receive the payment.
